# RBI3 Modifier a.k.a. The RibEye 3 Modifier from rbi3.ca 

This project is long abandoned and I have uploaded everything to Github for archival purposes. 

This repo contains everything needed to stand up a version of this online. 

The folks over at Temcobowl.org have stood up a copy: https://rbi3.tecmobowl.org/index.html (and as of 2025-02-28, I believe it works!)

Legacy screenshots follow!
